"           Rates are the number of reported offenses per 100,000 population"

          Crime rates are not available for agencies that report data for less than 12 months of a year.

" Illinois agencies 1985-2009 - The data collection methodology for the offense of forcible rape used by the State Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program does not comply with national UCR Program guidelines. Consequently, their figures for forcible rape and violent crime (of which forcible rape is part) are not included in this tool."

" The exception, however, is Rockford, Illinois. The agency has provided valid forcible rape crime counts as of 2006."
